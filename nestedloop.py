# nested loop = is the general concept of having one loop inside another loop.# nested loop = the 'inner loop' will finish all of its iterations before finishing the iteration of the 'outer loop'# To best demonstrate this we will create a program to draw a rectangle made out of a symbol of our choice.# We need to set a width, height and the symbol of choice.rows = int(input("How many rows?: "))columns = int(input("How many Columns: "))symbol = input('What symbol would you like to use?: ')# Now it's time for the nested loop. We're going to create an outer for loop and an inner for loop.# The outer for loop will be in charge of the rows and the inner the columns.for i in range(rows):    for j in range(columns):  # This loop will be iterated first.        print(symbol, end="")  # This will print the symbol once every iteration. Will iterate 'columns' times.# After we use a print statement the console will start a new line. We don't want this when defining the columns so we add "end=".    print()                    # This will print the symbol once every iteration. Will iterate 'rows' times.    # We do want a new line when defining rows. So we add a print statement that is empty to initiate a new row per iteration.
